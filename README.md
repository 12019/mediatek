MediaTek kernel sources

Sources are provided/leaked from following devices/Android versions: 

	MT6752 - (none) 
	MT6732 - Elephone P6000 (Android 4.4.4)
	MT6595 - (none) 
	MT6592 - Device codename 'BIRD92' (Android 4.4.2)
	MT6591 - (none) 
	MT6589 - (none) 
	MT6582 - (none) 
	MT6572 - (none) 

Instructions to build are usually located within the readme files in the root folders of the kernel source code. 

UPDATE: MediaTek (Elephone) and XDA have requested for me to remove the sources from my GitHub. I don't see the point of removing them if they're supposed to be open-sourced. Many developers also have MediaTek kernel source code lying around in their GitHubs, so really, I don't think I'll take it down from here. 

An outdated build guide is here: http://wenku.baidu.com/view/86c3bad749649b6648d74748.html
